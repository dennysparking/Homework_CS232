Britton and I worked well together,and I feel like we split the load pretty close to 50/50.
I spent close to 10 hours outside of class researching, and spending time on structs and tries. We were able to get a lot of work done pretty quickly and this resulted in us being one of the first groups done.
I would definitley work with Britton again!
